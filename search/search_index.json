Mapping tools will make suggestions on which repeater was actually involved, but no concrete link will ever be made.</li> <li>Association: For every data point, repeaters involved in its transmission are associated based on their GPS coordinates.  If a repeater is ever relocated, all links to its coverage data are broken to ensure actual coverage is not skewed.</li> <li>Authentication: Every wardriving session is validated against known mesh nodes.</li> </ul> <p>MeshMapper believes in the ownership and control of how a regions data is presented lies with the region itself.
