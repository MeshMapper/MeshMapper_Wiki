No repeats heard, did not make it into the wider mesh. <p>Example: If a grid square contains 10 failed pings (Red) and 1 successful ping (Green), the square will appear Green to indicate that coverage is possible at that location.</p>"},{"location":"visuals/#ping-types-defined","title":"Ping Types Defined","text":"<p>Here is a detailed breakdown of the different coverage statuses:</p> <ul> <li> <p>BIDIRECTIONAL (BIDIR) - Green</p> <ul> <li>You sent a message, it was received by a repeater, and your radio heard the repeater send it back.</li> <li>This confirms a solid two-way link.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>DISCOVERY (DISC) - Cyan</p> <ul> <li>Your radio sent a specialized \"Discovery\" packet, and a node responded.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>TRANSMIT (TX) - Orange</p> <ul> <li>Your message was successfully sent into the mesh (it reached a repeater), but your radio did not hear the confirmation repeat.</li> <li>This often happens when you have a high-power transmitter but a lower-gain antenna for receiving, or if the repeater is far away.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>RECEIVE (RX) - Purple</p> <ul> <li>Your radio heard packets from the mesh (e.g., other users, telemetry), but you did not transmit.</li> <li>Useful for mapping where the mesh can be heard, even if you cannot reach it.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>DEAD - Grey</p> <ul> <li>A repeater heard your signal, but the message didn't go anywhere (it wasn't repeated to the rest of the mesh).</li> <li>This usually indicates a \"Zombie\" repeater, a misconfigured repeater that is receiving but not routing, or the repeater does not have a reliable connection into the wider mesh.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>DROP - Red</p> <ul> <li>You sent a message, but no repeaters heard it, and no route was established.</li> <li>Indicates a dead zone or lack of coverage.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"visuals/#popups-data","title":"Popups &amp; Data","text":"<p>Clicking on a grid square opens a popup with detailed information.</p>"},{"location":"visuals/#1-summary-view","title":"1.
