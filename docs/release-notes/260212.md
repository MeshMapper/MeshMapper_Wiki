# 🚀 MeshMapper Update - Admin Tools & Map Enhancements (February 12, 2026)

### ✨ New Features

* **Detailed vs. Simplified Map Views** — Added a toggle in Settings to switch between "Detailed" (full grid resolution) and "Simplified" (clustered repeaters, optimized grid) modes. Simplified mode significantly improves performance on slower devices.  Simplified mode is now the default.
* **Discord Integration** — Region administrators can now link their Discord!  This will allow administrators to receive notifications about their region from the MeshMapper bot (for example, when a new repeater has sent an advert and its ID is now in collision).  Find this setting in the "User Settings" tab of the admin panel.
* **Administration Popup** — A new "Administration" option on the map displays the region's administrators and contact information, making it easier for visitors to reach out to local maintainers.  Visitors can send messages to the administrators through the Discord integration/MeshMapper bot here, if there is at least one region administrator with their Discord linked and that notification type is enabled.
* **Region Message** — Administrators can now set a custom message (e.g., local Discord server invite, website link) that appears to visitors in the Administration popup.  This allows administrators to direct map visitors to local resources.
* **Disable Duplicate ID Detection** — Added the ability for region admins to opt-out of strict duplicate ID detection. This allows regions to visualize all data even if repeater IDs collide.  [Read about this in more detail here.](https://wiki.meshmapper.net/overrideduplicates/)
* **Onboarding Status** — New regions pending onboarding will display in the Maps dropdown with a landing page indicating that onboarding is pending.  Optionally linking ones Discord with the onboarding form allows for automated status updates sent directly from the MeshMapper bot.
* **Users** — Region administrators now have the ability to create Users.  Creating a User allows you the ability to combine multiple companions under a single "primary" companion, which will aggregate a users statistics and contributions under that single companion on the leaderboard.  This is also the first stepping stone into a planned portal that will allow end-users the ability to manage their own contributions, see their own detailed statistics, etc.

### 🛠️ Improvements

* **Multiregion Management** — Regions within a multiregion group can now be managed independently, giving local admins more control while remaining part of the larger group.
* **Admin Panel Enhancements** —
    * Improved filtering and sorting capabilities for data management and export.
    * Added tool parity for multiregion administrators, ensuring they have access to the same maintenance utilities as single-region admins.
* **Onboarding Checks** — Strengthened the validation logic during the region onboarding process to ensure configuration accuracy.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

* **Admin Panel** — Various bug fixes and stability improvements within the Admin Panel.
