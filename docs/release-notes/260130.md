# 🌐 MeshMapper Web Update (January 30, 2026)

### ✨ New Features

* **DISC Mapping Complete** — DISC packets now appear on the leaderboard and map. Collision logic has been updated: while BIDIR/TX/RX remain hidden for collided repeaters, DISC pings will still show. DISC pings now link to repeaters via their full public key, bypassing duplicate ID logic.
* **Hidden Repeaters** — Any repeater with the 🚫 emoji in its name is now removed from the map. Associated pings display as "hidden" (no ID shown), but statistics like max distance and coverage level remain. The leaderboard still lists the repeater, but with the name stripped. This aligns with the MeshCore official app behavior.
* **Configurable Stale Timer** — The stale repeater timeout is now adjustable per region and multi-region group (previously hardcoded to 24h). These settings can be found in the region and master admin panels.
* **Copy Link Button** — Ping and repeater popups now feature a clipboard icon. Clicking it copies a direct link to that specific grid square or repeater, making it easier to share locations instead of screenshots.

### 🔧 Improvements & Fixes
