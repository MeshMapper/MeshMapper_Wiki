!!! danger "Forced Update"
    **Please update your app immediately.** All previous versions have been disabled. We discovered critical bugs that were incorrectly marking successful bidirectional pings as DEAD tiles.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

* **SEA Region Configuration & Session Limit** — SEA was mistakenly configured to allow zero Active sessions, but a recent app bug was ignoring this limit entirely. This let everyone Active wardrive when they shouldn't have, causing successful pings to appear as DEAD. Both the server config and app have been corrected.
* **API Queue Fix** — A recent simplification to the app's API queue had unintended consequences causing DEAD pings in BNA. This has been reverted/fixed.
* **Infinite Session Fix** — If the app was backgrounded, it could keep calling its heartbeat forever. Now the app properly stops heartbeat calls when disconnected from BLE or backgrounded and not in use.
* **Minor IATA Display Bug** — Visual only, wasn't causing data issues, but now fixed.
* **Clearer Bluetooth Messaging** — You'll now see a proper "Bluetooth required" message when trying to connect, and the scan button is hidden when BLE is disabled.
