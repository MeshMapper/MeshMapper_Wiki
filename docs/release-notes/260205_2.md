# 📱 MeshMapper Native App v1.0.0 (1770351949)

### 🧪 Hybrid Mode (EXPERIMENTAL)

* **New mode available** as a toggle in Settings. When enabled, the Active button is replaced with a Hybrid button. (Huge kudos to @HerculesMulligan for the idea!)
* **Alternates between Discovery and Active pings** each interval.
* **Timing:** At a 15s interval, each ping type fires every 30s (alternating), resulting in 50% less TX flood airtime compared to Active Mode at the same interval.
* *Please test and report back with your findings!*

### ✨ New Features

* **Auto-reconnect to device** on Bluetooth disconnect. This addresses a common issue on Apple devices where unplugging power would kill wardriving sessions. The app now automatically retries the connection and resumes the last active mode. (Thanks @FLAN-MAN)
* **Tap the version number** to copy it to your clipboard. (Thanks @Dharmansible)

### 🔧 Improvements

* **Debug log files** on the Settings tab now display timestamps instead of raw filenames.
* **Removed the exit button** from map controls; map can now only be maximized or minimized. (Thanks @d.blair)
* **Resolved two issues** flagged during Apple App Store review in preparation for official submission.
* **General code cleanup** and stability improvements.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

* **Fixed the noise floor graph** freezing and no longer updating after a period of time. (Thanks @ka.RFz (YVR))
