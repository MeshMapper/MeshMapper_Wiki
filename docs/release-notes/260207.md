# 📱 MeshMapper Native App v1.0.0 (1770442286)

### ⚡ Improvements

* **Connection may now take a few seconds longer** on initial setup. The app now scans all 40 channel slots for an existing wardriving channel before creating one, preventing duplicate channels from being added to your device.
* **Discovery pings now behave consistently** with TX pings. A grey marker is placed on the map as soon as a discovery request is sent, and changes to purple when repeater responses are heard.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

* Fixed incorrect repeater responses for discovery pings showing up on the noise floor graph.
* Fixed grey discovery pings (no repeater responses) not appearing on the map.
* Fixed the user marker not staying centred when auto-follow + heading mode were enabled, especially with the control panel maximized.
* Fixed a timing issue in hybrid mode that stopped alternating TX and discovery pings from firing at the 15s interval (Thanks @HerculesMulligan).
* Fixed a visual timer sync issue in hybrid mode that caused the button to flash orange for 1 second.
* Fixed missing status indicator when sending discovery pings.
* Fixed map rotation animations to be smoother.
