# 🚀 MeshMapper Update - Multiregion Evolution (February 5, 2026)

### ✨ New Features

* **Unified Multiregion Architecture** — Regions that are part of a multiregion group are now much more deeply linked together. The backend now treats groups as cohesive entities while maintaining the flexibility of individual region databases.
* **Grouped Admin Panel** — Administrators managing regions that are part of a multiregion group now have a single, centralized portal to oversee all regions within their group simultaneously.
* **Multiregion Leaderboards** — Multiregions now display leaderboards and will contribute as a group to the global leaderboard.

### 🛠️ Improvements & Fixes

* **Global Duplicate Detection** — Overhauled API logic to perform duplicate repeater scans across the entire group rather than just the individual region. This ensures that a repeater is recognized as the same entity regardless of which region's observers hear it (as long as those regions share a group).
* **Map Consolidation** — To reduce confusion, individual region maps that are part of a group have been deprecated. Navigating to a specific region URL will now automatically redirect to the Grouped Map, providing a "single source of truth" for that mesh.

### 🔮 Looking Ahead

* **Automated Clustering** — This lays the groundwork for automatic region grouping. In the future, MeshMapper may suggest (or automatically perform) region grouping when a repeater from "Region A" is consistently heard by an observer in "Region B."
