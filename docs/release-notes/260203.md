# 🚀 MeshMapper Update - Backend and Map (February 3, 2026)

### ✨ New Features

* **Legacy Data Integration** — Developed a tool to ingest historical data via CSV import. Uploaded data now populates a dedicated "Legacy Data" layer on the map.
    * *Note: This is currently a "hidden" tool while we assess data submissions. It will shortly become available for region administrators. If you have legacy data to migrate, please reach out directly.*
* **Unit Preferences** — Users can now toggle between Imperial and Metric units directly from the settings icon on the map interface or leaderboards.
* **"Subscribe to All" Observers** — A new option is available during onboarding and within region admin panels. When enabled, this overrides manual MQTT observer ID input and automatically subscribes the region to all `letsmesh` observers in their IATA. Manual entry is still supported for specific exclusions.

### 🕰️ Previous Updates (Now Documented)

* **Discovery Support** — Discovery pings, since they contain the full public ID of the heard repeater, now bypass all duplicate repeater and display limitation logic and will associate with the appropriate repeater (and count towards leaderboard statistics).
* **New Map Layer: "Adv. Repeater Coverage"** — Displays connections to pings using their corresponding colours instead of just blue (green for bidirectional, orange for TX, etc.).
* **Bug Report/Feature Request** — Added ability to create a bug report or feature request from within the "About" window on any page.
* **Repeater Staleness** — Added ability to allow regional administrators to adjust the amount of time before a repeater is considered stale, replacing the default of 24 hours.
* **Maintenance Mode** — Added ability to display a warning notification to website visitors when planned maintenance is expected. Added ability to fully shut down the site and wardriving app if needed with clear messages explaining why.

### 🔐 Administrative Tools

* **Self-Service Passwords** — Region administrators can now updates their passwords directly within the admin portal.
* **Geofencing Adjustments** — Admins now have the ability to modify region radii or boundary polygons directly from the region administration page.
* **History** — Admins now see the history of what changes were made to their region.

### 🛠️ Improvements & Fixes

* **UI/UX Tweaks** — Refined various interface elements for a smoother navigation experience.
* **Bug Fixes** — Squashed some minor bugs to improve overall platform stability.
