# 📱 MeshMapper Native App v1.0.0 (1769747121)

### ✨ New Features

* **Submit Feedback** — New button under Settings lets you submit bug reports and feature requests directly from the app.
* **Upload Debug Logs** — Send debug logs privately to the dev team. Attaching logs to a bug report works the same way.
* **Full Repeater Key Capture** — Discovery requests now capture complete repeater public keys. Coming soon: coverage mapping for duplicate-ID repeaters based on discovery data.

### 🔧 Improvements

* **Removed Legacy Path Filter** — Removed an early filter that dropped RX packets with path lengths over 9. This was a quick fix for filtering corrupt packets in Ottawa but didn't scale to larger meshes. It's now replaced by proper decode/decrypt validation with ASCII readability checks. One user's 1-hour session was losing 30 RX pings due to this filter.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

* Fixed parser logic that failed to validate messages and adverts containing emojis, which was causing dropped packets.
